Again, we've only scratched the surface of what maps can do in iOS, but that just gives you more room to extend the app yourself! Try adding a UIAlertController action sheet that lets users specify how they want to view the map. There's a mapType property that draws the maps in different ways. For example, .satellite gives a satellite view of the terrain.

If you want to try something harder, you could typecast the return value from dequeueReusableAnnotationView() so that it's an MKPinAnnotationView. This will always be the case, because that's what we're creating. But once you typecast the return value, it means you can change the pinColor property to either .red, .green or .purple. With that information, try to add a "Favorite" button to cities: regular cities are red, favorites are green.
